# Facial Recognition using Siamese-Networks-for-One-Shot-Learning

Based on [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf) by Gregory Koch et al.

All the details are in the [report](DL_HW_2_Report.pdf).
Used the [Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/index.html)
